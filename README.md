It can not jump over to the very end, however, if there exists a discontinuity between the starting point and the destination.
 
There are three grasshoppers at each player's disposal by the default rule.

 "It can only move by one step at a time and can not squeeze into tiny openings. " 
  "The queen bee has to be out on the board within the first four moves."
